- Provide detailed reports to make things easier for maintainers.
- If there's a weird bug, please provide a reproduction repository on GitHub.

## Fixing existing issues

- You can help by [fixing existing issues](https://github.com/gustavomorinaga/github-unfollower-checker/issues).
- Don't work on issues assigned to others (to avoid duplicate efforts).
- Before starting to work on an issue, please first add a comment and ask to get assigned to that issue. This way everyone will know you're working on that and it avoids duplicate efforts.
- Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format.

## Feature requests

- If you have an idea to discuss with the community, please [open a discussion](https://github.com/gustavomorinaga/github-unfollower-checker/discussions).

## Pull requests

- A pull request must fix [an open issue](https://github.com/gustavomorinaga/github-unfollower-checker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) **assigned to you**. If there's no issue, please create one first. If it's not assigned to you, please ask for it in the comments. This is for avoiding duplicate efforts.
