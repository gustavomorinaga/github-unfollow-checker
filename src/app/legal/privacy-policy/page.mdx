**Last Updated:** 2025-03-21

Welcome to <a href={siteMetadata.openGraph.url}>{siteMetadata.applicationName}</a>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data in compliance with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect the following personal data to provide our services:

- **GitHub Access Token** â€“ Used to interact with the GitHub API (not stored permanently).
- **GitHub Followers & Following** â€“ Used to show user connections.
- **GitHub Profile Data** â€“ Used to display user information.

We do **not** collect or process any sensitive personal data (e.g., payment details, addresses, or emails).

## 2. How We Collect Data

We collect data when users **log in with GitHub** via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/). This allows us to access necessary GitHub API functionalities to provide our services.

## 3. Purpose of Data Processing

We collect and process user data for the following purposes:

- To connect to the GitHub API and view **unfollowers**, **not mutuals**, **followers**, and **following**.
- To allow users to **follow** or **unfollow** other users directly from our platform.
- To allow users to **whitelist** certain followers they donâ€™t want to unfollow.
- To enhance user experience.

We do **not** use this data for marketing, advertising, or any other purposes.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

Under GDPR, we process user data based on:

- **User Consent** â€“ Users grant permission by logging in with GitHub.
- **Legitimate Interest** â€“ We require access to GitHub data to provide our core service.

## 5. User Rights

As a user, you have the following rights under GDPR:

- **Access:** You can request a copy of your personal data directly from GitHub.
- **Deletion:** Since we do not store your data permanently, you can revoke our access to your GitHub data by disconnecting our application from your GitHub account.
- **Correction:** Any updates to your data should be made directly in GitHub, as we only process GitHub data.
- **Data Portability:** You can request your data directly from GitHub in a structured format.

To exercise any of these rights, please refer to GitHub's privacy settings or contact GitHub support.

## 6. Data Sharing

We do **not** share your personal data with any third parties.

## 7. Security Measures

We take data protection seriously. Our security measures include:

- **Authentication & Authorization** via [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/).
- **Secure Hosting** on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- **Access Controls** to limit data exposure.

## 8. Data Retention

We retain user data **only while the user is actively using our service**. If a user stops using our service, the data is no longer processed.

## 9. International Data Transfers

As we use third-party services like **Vercel**, user data may be transferred outside the **EU**. We ensure that all data transfers comply with **GDPR safeguards**, such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or equivalent mechanisms.

## 10. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes via a **website notice**.
